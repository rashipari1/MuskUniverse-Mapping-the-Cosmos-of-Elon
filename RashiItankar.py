His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.Musk's family was wealthy during his youth.His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father. Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.Maye Musk has said of her son that he \"was shy and awkward at school\" and \"didn't have many friends\".At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.At age twelve, he sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500."},
            {"heading": "Education", "text": "Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School, from where he graduated.Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill.In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School.Although Musk claims he earned the degrees in 1995, UPenn maintains it awarded them in 1997.He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.In 1995, he was accepted to a PhD program in materials science at Stanford University.However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom, instead dropping out two days after being accepted and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response."},
            {"heading": "Business career", "text": "In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2.Errol Musk provided them with $28,000 in funding.The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,with Musk coding the website every night.Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share."},
            {"heading": "SPACEX", "text": "In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars. In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.With $100 million of his own money, Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant) Mike Griffin later that year.After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on an inland platform. Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform. In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.Since 2019,SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS."},
            {"heading": "Starlink", "text": "In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.However, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million."},
            {"heading": "TESLA", "text": "Telsa.inc - originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.Tesla began delivery of an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012. A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017. The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.Since its initial public offering in 2010,Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.In November 2021, Musk proposed, on Twitter, to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week, and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale. In 2022, Musk unveiled a robot developed by Tesla, Optimus.[138] On June 20, 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, suggesting that he might be interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\"."},
            {"heading": "SolarCity and Tesla Energy", "text": "Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant. Two years later, the court ruled in Musk\'s favor."},

            {"heading": "Futuristic Ideas", "text": "Elon Musk’s Ideas for the Future Elon Musk has blown up in popularity this year for being the owner of the companies SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal, and many other famous companies. His main goal is to revolutionize transportation on Earth and even in space! With a net worth of 22 billion dollars, he is very important today. His approach to the 21st century is to go straight for what he wants, even if it seems impossible. The way Elon thinks of things is what seems impossible is a possibility to him which is where he thinks of these ideas.                                                               1. Hyperloop : The Hyperloop is perhaps one of the most futuristic of his ideas. The goal for the Hyperloop is to be able to travel at extremely high speeds in a tunnel to get to somewhere like San Francisco from Los Angeles in 30 minutes. The Hyperloop is supposed to top out at about 700 mph. It has completed a successful test already but designs are still in the making for it. Something going this fast on the ground can be revolutionary for transportation, and the cost is going to be low too.                                                                                                                                                     2. Colonizing Mars : Colonizing Mars has to be the most ambitious thing Elon Musk wants to do. His first stage of executing this plan was to make a greenhouse on the planet. According to Musk, lush foliage would “Reignite the thirst for space travel and restore funding to major institutions like NASA. Musk knows that the problem with executing this plan would be the cost of transport, but this problem is also getting resolved by him. He expects his company, SpaceX, to be able to commence the colonization plants sometime in the 2030s and have a colony on Mars set up by 2040. TrustedReviews.com states that “If we have a linear improvement in technology, as opposed to logarithmic, then we should have a significant base on Mars, perhaps with thousands or tens of thousands of people”. The first batch of people that are going to travel will need to pay their own way to Mars at a pricey cost of $500,000, but 2030 isn’t for another 11 years.                                                             3. Elon Musk wants people to have access to Wi-Fi from every corner of the world : While some of us can’t imagine waking up and not checking our SoMe straight away, there are people in the most remote areas of the world, not knowing what internet is. Elon Musk wants to change that. His plan is to launch more than 4000 satellites into low orbit. Why? In order to reach those remote areas around the globe. However, he isn’t the only one planning such project. Greg Wyler, founder of OneNet and backed by the Virgin Group has set his eyes on the same goal.                                                                                                         4. Linking our brains to a computer : Elon Musk has launched Neuralink, a company developing ultra high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers.. The technology being used is called ‘neural lace’ and it works by placing electrodes in the brain. That would allow people to upload or download their thoughts to a computer. Based in San Francisco, Neuralink is currently hiring. You can see all the open positionshere and maybe even give it a shot!"}
